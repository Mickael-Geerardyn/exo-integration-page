# exo-integration-page
This is one page which I was need to create for a client which contain static html/css part and dynamic javascript/Jquery part

The javascript/Jquery was used to create a vanilla carroussel. It was a choice I did to improve the skills in programmation langages and algorithm logic.

You can see the result here : https://exo.quebec/fr/a-propos/carrieres
